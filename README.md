# Django Template

### Overview

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project template which creates a
structure revolving around the use of 
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) for keeping 
development and deployment environments as similar as possible, while also 
easing ongoing maintenance tasks.

Also provides a number of custom apps as a starting point: registration with 
Facebook auth, a landing page, and admin improvements.

(originally inspired by the 
[Izeni Django Template](https://dev.izeni.net/izeni/izeni-django-template), 
to which @luke contributed heavily while employed there)
