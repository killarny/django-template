# Django Template

### Overview

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project template which creates a
structure revolving around the use of 
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) for keeping 
development and deployment environments as similar as possible, while also 
easing ongoing maintenance tasks.

(originally inspired by the 
[Izeni Django Template](https://dev.izeni.net/izeni/izeni-django-template), 
to which @luke contributed heavily while employed there)


### Quick-start

    ```

1. Follow the instructions in the new __README.md__ in your project directory.

1. Address any _**TODO**_ items in the new __README.md__ in your project directory.
